Some text to start my path in github.
This should be fun

The vertical farming rig is an indoor solution to the problems faced by many urban homes especially in areas where agriculture is a rear practice.
So, what can I do to make this work? How do I get food on your table or how can I used the sophisted home space to make quality food as seen in rural and conventional farms? (Find the attached images)

Le___or is an automated vertical farm that work with solar energy to provide power such as lighting, computational power and automation to grow indoors.
Le___or features a smart LED array that works with different LEDs (colored filmed to be used for experimental cases) to provide the right spectrums of light required by specify plants for accelerated and healthy growth.
The automation process is controlled via a microprocessor onsite and a cloud based computation to take data and send the right instructions via to actuators such as pumps etc.

I would be back for more update on the vertical farming rig.
